# LaTeX Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning LaTeX and storing necessary documents related to LaTeX. It includes templates, snippets, and notes that may be useful for anyone interested in LaTeX.

## Thesis Proposal Template

As part of this repository, I am using a thesis proposal template provided by Overleaf, specifically the **Telkom University Final Project template**. You can find the template here:

[Telkom University Final Project Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/telkomuniversity-finalproject/vxwsdvmzdtcd)

## Tools I Use

- **LaTeX Distribution**: [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/)
- **Editor**: [TeXMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)

These tools are essential for compiling and editing LaTeX documents on my local machine.

## Structure of the Repository

- **tutorial*/**: The space i explore LaTeX.
- **template-thesis-proposal/**: My reference for the proposal template.

## Getting Started

    ```
2. Open any `.tex` file using TeXMaker or directly in Overleaf.
